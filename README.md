# Flow-field-dots-nav-
A flow field navigation system that works in Unity dots system with jobs and burst adapted from tutorials by Turbo Makes Games.  

It works fully in dots with pretty much fully bursted.  It gets and converts gameobject colliders into obstacles that block the squares on the flowfield.
It also has a layer system so that on a single flowfield you can have entities with multiple directions.

Edit:  The frame rate is not to great in the gif because I'm using the base renderer and didn't disable some of the safety checks.
